### Hi there 👋

I'm Nikhil!

👨‍💻 I'm an experienced **Ruby, Python, and React** developer with a keen understanding of business requirements.  
👨‍💻 I do, occasionally, work with Elixir, Vimscript, and Lua, and even tested out [Emacs Lisp](https://github.com/nikhgupta/emacs-preamble) at some point.  
📸 I do love programming, but I can be spotted capturing a moment with my Canon EOS-R or editing a video (using Davinci Resolve).

🔭 I'm, currently, exploring Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and Vector databases.  
📫 The best way to reach out to me is via [Email](me@nikhgupta.com) or via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nikhgupta).

⚡ Fun fact: I love [speedcubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing). So far, my best has been **48s to solve the Rubix Cube**.
